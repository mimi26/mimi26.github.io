Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Fonts and some Bootstrap

I started with the page I originally made for my application and made it a bit more professional looking. I also made some changed to incorporate things I've learned since then, such as changing the image links from absolute to relative. 


I used smooth scroll code found here: http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/quick-guide-adding-smooth-scrolling-to-your-webpages/
